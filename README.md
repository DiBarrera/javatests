# Java testing

## Java testing is about checking the correct functionality of the code, to result in a bus-free code and have an efficient development.

<!-- Overviwe -->
## Overviwe

In this repository you will find a brief summary of what was learned in the [platzi](https://platzi.com/cursos/testing-java/) course of Java testing.

---------

Testing in java serves to check the functionality of the code that is generated during the development of a project, it helps to make it bus-free, clean and readable, during this course the basics to generate testing code and how to apply it in an application under development were taught.

---------

This repository is divided into the following parts.
* The steps to clone the repository and be able to view it.
* The main topics seen in the course
* Some of the basics concepts taught.
* Skills acquired at the end of the course.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### For this repository, IntelliJ Idea was used as IDE

### For this repository, Maven was used as the build automation tool

### For this repository, JUnit was used as the testing framework 

### The framework used for testing in this repository is: [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/).

## Setup

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

```shell
$ mkdir java-testing
$ cd java-testing
$ git clone https://github.com/DiBarrera/javatests.git
```

You will find the following files:

- **The src directory**, containing the main files used for the course.
- **The test directory** contains the files generated to test the classes created in src.

- To tell Maven that we will use Java 8 we must add the following lines of code:

```shell
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8maven.compiler.target>
properties>
```

- To add Mockito in the project we insert the following lines:

```shell
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mockitogroupId>
  <artifactId>mockito-coreartifactId>
  <version>2.23.4version>
  <scope>testscope>
dependency>
```

- To perform a database integration test we will use Spring and H2, insert the following lines into the dependencies:

```shell
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframeworkgroupId>
  <artifactId>spring-jdbcartifactId>
  <version>5.1.3.RELEASEversion>
dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.h2databasegroupId>
  <artifactId>h2artifactId>
  <version>1.4.197 version>
dependency>
```



<!-- Topics reviewed -->
## Topics reviewed

The topics seen in this course, provided the knowledge to be able to create tests and verify the correct operation of a java application, these are the main topics learned.

### Topics

- What is a Test.
- TDD (Test Driven Development).
- Different types of tests.
- Unitary. 
- Integration. 
- Functional. 
- End to End.
- Stress.
- Unit test.
- Test organization with JUnit.
- Organization of an application.
- Integration test.




<!-- Basics -->
## Basics

#### Inform JUnit that we expect an exception
Pure functions generate the same result for the same parameter.
```markdown
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
``` 
---------

## Here are some steps that were followed in the course, to achieve the CRUD actions with the database.
These steps are written so that the reader can get an idea of how the application was created to achieve the main objectives of the course. Although the repository contains the completed application in its entirety.

### A basic test, using "throw new".
Using "throw to" we can receive indication of which line the error occurred.
- For this example, we need two classes, in our package we create a class name StringUtil.java, will have the next lines:
- #### StringUtil.java
```markdown
package com.platzi.javatests.util;
public class StringUtil {
    public static String repeat(String str, int times) {
        String result = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
            result += str;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
``` 
- We insert a for loop with the purpose of reapting a simple text, that would be subject of our test.
- Now we create a class in the test package with the name of StringUtilTest.java
- #### StringUtilTest.java
```markdown
package com.platzi.javatests.util;
public class StringUtilTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        assertEquals(StringUtil.repeat("hola", 3), "holaholahola ");
        assertEquals(StringUtil.repeat("hola", 1), "hola");
    }
    private static void assertEquals(String actual, String expected) {
        if (!actual.equals(expected)) {
            throw new RuntimeException(actual + " is not equal to expected " + expected);
        }
    }
}
``` 
- As you can see, in the previous code, inside public static void main, we have an assertEquals, that would repeat a text a number of times, and is expecting the repeated text as a second parameter.
- Pay atention to the blank space after the repeated text.
- #### StringUtilTest.java
```markdown
package com.platzi.javatests.util;
public class StringUtilTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
                                                                // but thereÂ´s a space here
                                                                |
        assertEquals(StringUtil.repeat("hola", 3), "holaholahola ");
        assertEquals(StringUtil.repeat("hola", 1), "hola");
    }
}
``` 
- When running the program, with the use of "throw new we can receive an indication of which line the error is occurring on.

#### This is a small example of a unit test.
